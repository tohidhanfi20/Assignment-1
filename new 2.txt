IN this assignment i created an rds database on mariadb engine. 
With free tier configurations and at the same time i created an  Two ec2 instances as load balancing requires atleast two instances.
Then i configured the security group so that the port for the databases is enabled and ports like http icmp etc.
After that i installed sql server with mariadb as a engine on my both ec2 instances. using yum install mariadb command.
Then i have hecked wheather the db is running or not by (systemctl enable mariadb) and (systemctl start mariadb)
After that now its time to connect my ec2 instance to my database as we got the endpoints.
using following command i have connected my ec2 with rds :-mysql -h rdsxec2.cww3jlwugwt6.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -p 3306 -u admin -p admin123
in this -h is enpoint -p is the port -u is the user -p is the password. 

After this now the last step is to connect our ec2 instancewith a load balancer so that the traffic load is balanced.
First we have to take application LB for http and https 
And have to create target groups for the both the instances have to add port listeners also so that it can be accessed by 
by the port 80 i.e http  

Here are the screenshots of what i have created:-
